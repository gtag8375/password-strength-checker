For this project I chose the MIT license because of its usefulness for a student like me,
with its ability to grant usage, modification, and distribution to others who might be interested in learning more about security concepts with clojure.
It also helps that liability and warranty are placed on users of this software, ensuring that if my software is used for malicious purposes,
I'm not help legally responsible for this. 
Using the MIT License is also useful if people would like to contribute to my project in the future, and if it turns out that my software
is financially useful I can still change the license at a later date without worrying, unlike a GLP license.
